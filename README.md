# Prompt-Driven Problem Solving

Prompt-driven practice for building structured Python and Java solutions using core problem-solving patterns.

## Overview

This repository is a deliberate practice space focused on improving the way I design and implement solutions to programming problems.

Each exercise begins with a generated prompt.  
Before writing code, the solution is broken down into a clear step-by-step plan using a **words → code table**, where logical actions are translated into their programmatic equivalents.

This approach reinforces structured thinking and helps formalise the process of turning requirements into clean, predictable, and maintainable code.

Prompts are generated with the assistance of ChatGPT to provide a consistent and scalable source of practice problems.

## Workflow

For every prompt:

1. Understand the problem and identify the required behaviour
2. Develop the solution as an algorithm in plain language
3. Convert the algorithm into a **words → code mapping**
4. Implement the final solution in Python or Java
5. Refactor for clarity and structure where necessary

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Strengthen algorithmic thinking
- Build a consistent problem-solving methodology
- Write more intentional and professional code
- Bridge the gap between pseudocode and implementation
- Develop habits that scale to larger software projects

Rather than treating problems as isolated exercises, this repo focuses on repeatable techniques that lead to well-structured solutions.

## Structure

Each folder contains:

- The original prompt
- The planning process (words → code table)
- The final implementation

## Long-Term Focus

Over time, these solutions will serve as a foundation for:

- Faster problem decomposition
- Cleaner program design
- Easier refactoring into modular and testable components
- Applying the same structured approach to more complex systems

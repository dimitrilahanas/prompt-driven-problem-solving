## Prompt 02 — Count Passing and Failing Marks

Write a program that continuously asks the user to enter a student mark.

The program should stop when the user enters `-1`.

After the input has finished, display:

- The number of passing marks (marks greater than or equal to 50)
- The number of failing marks (marks below 50)

If no marks are entered before `-1`, display the message:

No marks were entered.
